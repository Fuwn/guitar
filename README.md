  <b>A toolkit for string-based instruments</b>
</p>

`guitar` includes a number of tools for working with string-based instruments
with planned support for fret-less instruments.

At the moment, the library is in a very early stage of development and is
subject to change; however, many of the core features such as `Note`,
`Fretboard`, `Pitch`, and a number of conversion functions are stable.
